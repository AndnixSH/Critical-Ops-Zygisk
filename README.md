- Zygisk Mod Menu for Critical Ops

Made by chr1s (c___s) and 0x777 (1333337)

Used to be a public menu that I planned on updating but changed my mind and dropped it.
Aimbot & ESP only : https://github.com/0xa455

Has a shitton of features, feel free to skid :)


- Note

I dont know if the menu is patched, don't contact me for help or spoonfeeeding.

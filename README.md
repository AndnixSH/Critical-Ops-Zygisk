- Zygisk Mod Menu for Critical Ops

Made by chr1s (c___s) and 0x777 (1333337)

Used to be a public menu that I planned on updating but changed my mind and dropped it.

Aimbot & ESP only : https://github.com/0xa455

Has a shitton of features, feel free to skid :)


- Note

I dont know if the menu is patched, i dont remember half of the code here, don't contact me for help or spoonfeeding.

This source code is bad, Made it while I was making Pixel gun.
